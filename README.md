# Flexi-guitar

Fun project that aims to create a flexible guitar interface where one can experiement with
different tunings and see scales and chords.

## My problem
I love my 90's rock. A lot of 90's rock uses weird n wacky tunings. 
I also love my guitar theory and find following scales to be incredibly important when jamming.

This website is meant to address the problem of knowing scale and chord positions when using
an alternative tuning.
